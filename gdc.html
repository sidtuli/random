            <h4>Monday (Feb 27) 11:20 AM - 12:20 PM</h4>

            <ul>
            <li>
                Discussed algorithmic way to create ambience with several elements - "tetronimos of notes"
            </li>
            <li>
                Made odd ways to record sound:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stethoscope over microphone
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wire Recorder
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pitch shifting pig squeals
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Heavy emphasis on iterative process and constantly adding layers to musicand sfx
            </li>
            <li>
                Need to have sfx and music mesh but still be unique/distinct (different layers for them)
            </li>
            <li>
                Communication is key for sound - it's a very iterative and intensely team oriented work
            </li>

            <h3>Mata Haggis (Associate Professor - NHTV University, Breda, & Copper Stone Sea)</h3>
            <h4>Monday (Feb 27) 3:50 - 4:20 PM</h4>
            <ul>
            <li>
                Presents charts between challenge vs. difficulty, and narrative/conflict tension vs. time
            </li>
            <li>
                Both these charts have pseudo x vs. y lines with sections around them - "flow channels"
            </li>
            <li>
                It is very important to stay in "flow sections"
            </li>
            <li>
                Story is about change - fueled by many factors
            </li>
            <li>
                Players and designers have goals for game
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow story and events to be built to, give all things meaning by contrasting it to past
            </li>
            <li>
                World is built -> inciting incident -> player exploration -> player acts with intention -> challenges and complexity -> rise to action -> final choice -> end
            </li>
            <li>
                Most stories follow above order but you may want to add introduction (possibly a "bite of power" to rebuild back to later) or a looming ending
            </li>
            <li>
                Each scene has: objective, conflict, and outcome
            </li>
            <li>
                Create rewarding experiences through "valleys of conflict"
            </li>

                Odd exploration of life philosophy and focus. The need for depth and shallow

            <li>
                The need to fully enjoy what one does

                Starting is hard and so is finishing. At the end you get good as what you've done but resolve to start and complete anew is hard.

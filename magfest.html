                It was pretty cool to see how much the RC2 Community has been able to do with such an old game.
                Seems like it has a lot of interesting contests and assets being added custom made
                Also exposed me to seeing how much people have pulled from the base game 
                <a href="https://www.nedesigns.com/">New Elements Design Website - RC2 Creator Hub (also has other content around the game)</a>

                9:00 pm -> 10:00 pm
                We didn't really stay very long at this panel but it was fun to see a small background on neopets.
                It was also cool to see some perspective on how the game has become derelict in areas as well as how the site has changed between owners.
                Also was cool to know the panel organizer was one of the peoplethat got the current smaller Neopets owning company to affirm LGBT rights in forums and in the game.
                They kinda bullied them into it but hey progress!
                We left a little after that.

                It was a fun panel, the guy did end up "beating" the game but it was funny to see him curse and get frustrated with split attention lol.
                His review notes were that it's important to list out simply what you did on a project to help with SEO as well as add location.
                Also make sure to use active language to highlight your exact responsibilities vs. skills as opposed to just listing what the project was.

                This was fun enough panel to attend with my friend.
                There was some interesting background on the movie on some behind the scenes stuff but most of it was easily grabbed from Matt's Wha Happun?
                However it is always great to see some clips from the movie with other fans and to be reminded of how fun the movie is.

                Very good movie, fun and earnest recap of the US eartbound experience and its fans that built their community on Starmen.net.
                It was wild seeing toby fox briefly, as well as the ending interview with Itoi where he affirmed a lot of fan hopes.
                The recreations of past earthbound fan history was also cute and funny.

                Cool panel, nice talk contextualizing the Silent Hill in a feminist light.
                Also the "where is the Dunkin' Donuts in Silent Hill?" interludes were fun and good ways to bring levity for darker stuff.
                It was funny seeing a couple cosplay up front as Maria and James.

            No idea when I actually played this but it was a neat game with MGS style stealth and 3D fighter moves in close quarters.
            I sucked at it and got my ass handed to me quickly.

            Not the biggest fan of the aesthetic but there was a neat color changing mechanic to getting power ups.

            An okay JRPG but moved a bit slow in my opinion. 
            I did like the unique mechanic of color flipping (black and white vs. white black) as a way to change up what classes or attacks the party could use.
            I don't know if I would like to play it much more but it was cute and well put together if not a bit hard to navigate.

            <h3>Dark Tides</h3>
            Played this later on but took many photos of the con setup.
            It's an interesting point and click adventure game. 
            I like the aesthetic but admittedly didn't get super far into the game (not sure if I missed a puzzle or missed a clue/object).
            Had a cute stoat (?) companion and dialogue was witty enough but had occasional camera issues and found it a bit hard to claim objects occasionally.

            Played very little of this, not sure if I had a control bug but it was very weird at frist to grasp.
            However it was an intersting but very hard roguelike kinda thing?
            Reminds me a bit of Downwell.

            I kinda digged it, really liked the art style, aesthetics, and presentation.
            Admitttedly not sure if I liked how easy it was to miss evidence and stuff for the first mystery.
            Also not sure if the demo really showed enough but I feel JRPGs demo poorly?

            A quirky JRPG.
            Not sure if I made a mistake choosing to play the demo of the story some chapters further ahead.
            Combat was fun enough but I missed some mechanics stuff and some of the Paper-Mario-esque attacks required way too much mashing or were too long.
            Also became very tough as I constantly dragged my party around to get healed.
            Story was funny enough, poking fun at some fourth wall mechanics.
            I did not like the sheer hard number of cutscenes but maybe I would be moe invested if I played the previous few chapters.

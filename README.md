## Status of pages
| Page              | Status | Notes |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| [flags](https://sidtuli.github.io/random/flags.html ) | 游릳 | Page is mostly functional, may need to update the flag json in the code as well as we could look to clean up the js styling and code in flags.js. Might also want to look into separate json for flag codes as well as flags css. Maybe look into making that its own tool for generating flag codes? Also make sure to check the geonames API stuff?|
| [testingjson1](https://sidtuli.github.io/random/testingjson1.html ) | 游릴 | Very simple jquery page to test html manipulation. Maybe clean up html or js?|
| [testingjson2](https://sidtuli.github.io/random/testingjson2.html ) | 游릴 | Simple jquery page to send out alerts. Maybe clean up html or js?|
| [testingjson3](https://sidtuli.github.io/random/testingjson3.html ) | 游린 | [FDA label API](https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/label/example-api-queries/ ) structure has changed, brand_name -> openfda.brand_name in query. Beyond that, maybe clean up the js comments and html? |

Also maybe slight clean up on js? |
